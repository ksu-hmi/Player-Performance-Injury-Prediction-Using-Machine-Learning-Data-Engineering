Player Performance & Injury Prediction Using Machine Learning & Data Engineering 

Overview  
This project uses **Machine Learning & Data Engineering** to:  
Predict player performance ratings before a match using past performance data  
Identify players at risk of injury using biometric & workload data  
Automate ETL Pipelines for real-time updates
Deploy a Flask API for real-time predictions 

Key Features  
Random Forest Regression Model
- Predicts player match ratings based on:  
  - Minutes Played
  - Goals & Assists
  - Pass Accuracy (%)
  - Fatigue Score

Random Forest Classification Model
- Predicts injury risk based on:  
  - Sleep Hours & Hydration Levels
  - Fatigue & Stress Index
  - Minutes Played & Match Workload

Tech Stack  
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask, Streamlit)

PostgreSQL (Relational Database for Player Data)

Prefect (ETL Automation for Data Processing) 

Flask REST API (For Serving ML Predictions)

Streamlit (Interactive Dashboard for User Inputs & Predictions)  


**Future Improvements**

Experiment with Deep Learning (LSTMs) for time-series predictions

Incorporate real-time IoT sensor data for player fatigue analysis

Expand system to support multiple sports (basketball, rugby, etc.)
