# Player Performance & Injury Prediction Using Machine Learning & Data Engineering

## Overview  
This project applies **Machine Learning & Data Engineering** to:  
- Predict player performance ratings before a match using historical performance data  
- Identify players at risk of injury using biometric and workload data  
- Automate ETL Pipelines for real-time data updates  
- Deploy a Flask API for serving machine learning predictions

## Key Features  
**Random Forest Regression Model**
- Predicts player match ratings based on:
  - Minutes Played
  - Goals & Assists
  - Pass Accuracy (%)
  - Fatigue Score

**Random Forest Classification Model**
- Predicts injury risk using:
  - Sleep Hours
  - Hydration Levels
  - Stress and Fatigue Index
  - Match Workload Data

## Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask, Streamlit)  
- **PostgreSQL** (Relational Database for Player Data)  
- **Prefect** (ETL Automation for data processing)  
- **Flask REST API** (for serving model predictions)  
- **Streamlit Dashboard** (for visualization and user inputs)

## Future Improvements  
- Experiment with Deep Learning models (e.g., LSTMs for time-series prediction)  
- Incorporate real-time IoT sensor data (wearables for player fatigue analysis)  
- Expand system to multiple sports like basketball, rugby, and more.
