# Project Roadmap: Player Performance and Injury Prediction

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created data extraction scripts (`extract_data.py`, `Insert_data.py`)
- [x] Built and trained machine learning models (`train_model.py`, `train_injury_model.py`)
- [x] Developed Flask API for player performance prediction (`app_player_performance.py`)
- [x] Developed Flask API for injury prediction (`app_injury.py`)
- [x] Created basic Streamlit dashboard for user predictions (`dashboard.py`)
- [x] Cleaned and prepared performance and injury datasets (`prepare_data.py`, `prepare_injury_data.py`)
- [x] Integrated CORS in Flask APIs to support web app communication

## In Progress
- [ ] Expand EDA with deeper visualizations (EDA.ipynb to be developed)
- [ ] Tune hyperparameters for RandomForest models for better accuracy
- [ ] Deploy models and API to AWS EC2 or Render

## Future Plans
- [ ] Add feature: Predict recovery time after injuries
- [ ] Improve dashboard with interactive visualizations
- [ ] Monitor model drift and retrain models as new data becomes available
